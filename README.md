# Dinnterest

Dinnterest is a single-page application that is a take on Pinterest devoted to Dinners. It allows the user to log in and add boards and "Dinns" to their boards. The boards and Dinns are specific to that user, and the Dinns are specific to each board.

## Details

When the user visits the application, they will see a landing page asking them to log in. After logging in via Google, they will see a page showing all of their boards. The user can then add a board or click on a board to show all of the Dinns on that board.

When the user is looking at a single board they can see all of the Dinns associated with that board. From there they can add a new Dinn and assign it to a specific board. The user can also update a Dinn, and on the update page they can change which board a Dinn is assigned to.

The user can log out at any time which will take them back to the log in landing page.
